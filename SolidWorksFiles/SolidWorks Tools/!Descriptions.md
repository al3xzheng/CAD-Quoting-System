3D Matrix
============================
This tool will create a 3D model of X,Y,Z vectors from a plain text 3D matrix data using any SolidWorks model as a vector object, with ability to add different sizes and spacings to each co-ordinate!


BatchProcess

CircleCenters
============================
This tool takes 5 (x,y) points and finds the center of all possible circles that could lie on any combination of those points, and also finds the average center of the centers. It also outputs the text calculations and a graphical display which can be saved as an image if required.


ConfigSearcher
============================
This is a small SolidWorks tool that searches an assembly or parts configuration specific properties for a certain field and value, and if found, returns the configuration in a list. Then all you have to do is double-click that configuration in the list to activate it within SolidWorks.


Engineering Toolbox
============================
This is a collection of common engineering parts such as RHS, PSA, PSC, Flat, Round, Bar, Plate, UAP etc… formed into a design library built on macros. At the click of a button the user can create a new part at a set size and have it automatically saved and the description set, all ready to be used in your models.


Fuel Economy Calculator
============================
Work out exactly how many miles per gallon/litre your car does, as well as the cost of fuel, the miles and costs per years and make a report!


GUID Creator Tool
============================
For programmers who need to create GUID’s for their software this little tool generates random GUID’s at the click of a button.


LaserMRP
============================
This SolidWorks tool runs on a selected folder and finds all parts within the folder (excluding sub-folders) and opens them, finds there bounds, thickness, number of pierces etc… It also asks the user for the material and labour costs, quanties and works out the cost to produce the part. All the information is saved into custom properties of the part, and then a drawing created with a 1:1 flat pattern of the part and a note on a separate layer containing the information again. The program then saves the drawing as a SolidWorks drawing, a DXF and a tif.


PropertyExtractor
============================
PropertyExtractor will extract all custom and configuration specific properties from a set of SolidWorks files without having to open them, and has been benchmarked on 10,000 files and 100,000 custom properties in 26 seconds!

The results are displayed in an explorer-like treeview style with the option to save out all results to a separate file for archiving/searching/printing.

Once installed a shortcut will be placed on the desktop.


PropertyWiper
============================
Another small tool for SolidWorks that simply deletes all custom properties from all files within a folder. Just extract the zip to your desired location and run the exe.


SaveAsX
============================
SaveAsX is a free tool that allows the user to quickly and easily save the active SolidWorks model into Jpeg, Tif, DXF or DWG at the click of a button, with the powerful ability to change the location and filename to anything they like based on normal text, the existing filename, any custom property within the model, and any combination of them. All of this happens in real-time with a preview output of the filename that will be created. Enjoy!


SWTools
============================
This tool allows the user to have as many buttons they want that can run SolidWorks macro files (.swp), outside of the SolidWorks window, freeing up toolbars and space inside of SolidWorks.
